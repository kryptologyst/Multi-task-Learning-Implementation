Project 973: Multi-task Learning Implementation
Description
Multi-task learning (MTL) involves training a model to perform multiple tasks simultaneously, sharing common representations between tasks. In this project, we will implement a multi-task learning framework to classify images while also predicting other attributes, such as age or gender, from the same image.

Python Implementation with Comments (Multi-task Learning for Image Classification and Attribute Prediction)
We'll build a multi-task model that simultaneously performs image classification (e.g., CIFAR-10) and attribute prediction (e.g., gender, age) from the same input. The model will have shared layers and separate branches for each task.

First, install the necessary libraries:

pip install torch torchvision
Now, here's the implementation:

import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim
from torchvision import datasets, transforms, models
from torch.utils.data import DataLoader
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
 
# Load CIFAR-10 dataset
transform = transforms.Compose([
    transforms.Resize((224, 224)),  # Resizing to fit ResNet50 input size
    transforms.ToTensor(),
    transforms.Normalize(mean=[0.485, 0.456, 0.406], std=[0.229, 0.224, 0.225])  # Pre-trained model normalization
])
 
train_dataset = datasets.CIFAR10(root='./data', train=True, download=True, transform=transform)
test_dataset = datasets.CIFAR10(root='./data', train=False, download=True, transform=transform)
 
# Split the dataset into train and validation sets
train_loader = DataLoader(train_dataset, batch_size=32, shuffle=True)
test_loader = DataLoader(test_dataset, batch_size=32, shuffle=False)
 
# Define the multi-task learning model
class MultiTaskModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(MultiTaskModel, self).__init__()
        self.resnet = models.resnet50(pretrained=True)  # Pre-trained ResNet50
        
        # Replace the final fully connected layer with a new one for shared feature extraction
        self.resnet.fc = nn.Identity()  # Remove the original fully connected layer
 
        # Task-specific branches
        self.classifier = nn.Linear(self.resnet.fc.in_features, 10)  # CIFAR-10 classification (10 classes)
        self.age_predictor = nn.Linear(self.resnet.fc.in_features, 1)  # Age prediction (1 output)
        self.gender_predictor = nn.Linear(self.resnet.fc.in_features, 2)  # Gender prediction (2 classes)
 
    def forward(self, x):
        # Extract features from the ResNet backbone
        features = self.resnet(x)
        
        # Task-specific predictions
        class_output = self.classifier(features)
        age_output = self.age_predictor(features)
        gender_output = self.gender_predictor(features)
        
        return class_output, age_output, gender_output
 
# Initialize the model, optimizer, and loss function
model = MultiTaskModel()
optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.001)
 
# Define loss functions for each task
classification_loss_fn = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()
regression_loss_fn = nn.MSELoss()
 
# Training the multi-task model
for epoch in range(5):  # Multi-task training for 5 epochs
    model.train()
    total_loss = 0
    for data, target in train_loader:
        optimizer.zero_grad()
 
        # Get predictions for each task
        class_output, age_output, gender_output = model(data)
        
        # Task-specific losses
        class_loss = classification_loss_fn(class_output, target)  # Classification loss
        age_loss = regression_loss_fn(age_output, target.float().view(-1, 1))  # Age regression loss
        gender_loss = classification_loss_fn(gender_output, target)  # Gender classification loss
        
        # Total loss as the sum of all task losses
        loss = class_loss + age_loss + gender_loss
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()
 
        total_loss += loss.item()
 
    print(f"Epoch {epoch+1}, Loss: {total_loss / len(train_loader)}")
 
# Evaluate the model on the test dataset
model.eval()
correct_classifications, correct_gender, total = 0, 0, 0
total_age_error = 0
 
with torch.no_grad():
    for data, target in test_loader:
        class_output, age_output, gender_output = model(data)
 
        # Classification accuracy
        _, predicted_class = torch.max(class_output, 1)
        correct_classifications += (predicted_class == target).sum().item()
 
        # Gender classification accuracy
        _, predicted_gender = torch.max(gender_output, 1)
        correct_gender += (predicted_gender == target).sum().item()
 
        # Age prediction error (MSE)
        total_age_error += torch.abs(age_output - target.float().view(-1, 1)).sum().item()
 
        total += target.size(0)
 
# Print results
print(f"Classification Accuracy: {100 * correct_classifications / total:.2f}%")
print(f"Gender Classification Accuracy: {100 * correct_gender / total:.2f}%")
print(f"Average Age Prediction Error: {total_age_error / total:.2f}")
Key Concepts Covered:
Multi-task Learning (MTL): A single model is trained to perform multiple tasks simultaneously, sharing common layers while having task-specific branches.

Shared Representation: The model learns a shared representation in the early layers, while separate output layers are dedicated to each task.

Task-specific Losses: Each task has its own loss function (e.g., cross-entropy loss for classification and mean squared error for regression).
